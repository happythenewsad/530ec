-1 if no correlated
1 if perfectly correlated



 a simple unsupervised baseline can be the cosine similarity between the bag-of-words representation sentence. You need to implement this simple baseline as a sanity check. This should reach a Pearson correlation of about 0.35 on the test set.

 seems like the STS wiki is a good resource
